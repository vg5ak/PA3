I imported the PA3Start into PA2. So there are two folders inside PA2, PA2Start and PA3Start.
In PA3Start I have java_cup, meggy, mjsimPictures, src, TestCases, and TestCasesMeggy. The TestCases and TestCasesMeggy do not actually house the
test cases. They were just in the Folder when I merged PA3Start. In the src folder I changed the mj.cup to return the Exps for each expression, the statements for each statement. Statement_List, and BlockStatement were added to mj.cup as well. I changed the main method so it returned a MainClass exp. In the CheckTypes.java I added error messages to every Overriden method, and I had conditions to check if the exps were the correct type. This took me a while because I had small errors such as incorrect semicolon placing all over the place, as well as the occasional wrong typecheck, I do feel like I got all of those but I may have missed one or two. The AVRgenVisitor class outputted the assembly code for each method. I made a printwriter and had it print the assembly code for each function. The problems that I had in this are figuring out when to use the In and Visit, that and I missed a lot of test cases and made small errors that I had to go back and fix. A small complaint I have for this lab is that there were barely any instructions. I may have eventually figured it out, but a little more instructions might have been helpful.

The two testcases are PA3Test1.java and PA3Test2.java
